            <h2>Banana Hacks</h2>
                <p>These hacks are going to be filled with fruit love, so lets slow down the ripening process of our Bananas by 
                    wrapping a piece of plastic  cling wrap around the crown of the banana bunch (the part where all the stems connect)
                    which in turn gives us a longer life. The same can be said about leaving them in a paper bag that can actually speed
                    up the rippening process.</p>

                <h2>Strawberry Hacks</h2>
                <p>Yet again we have another fruit hack larking in the shadows awaiting its turn for fruit glory,
                    this time around the process will be completely different by using vinegar which is known for its  antibacterial properties,
                    The method goes as such, soak your berries for 5 mins in a mixture of vinegar and water, next rinse your berrries and let them
                    dry before storing them in the fridge. Boom! you've just increased the life span of your fruit friends.

                <h2>Relaxtion Hacks</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p>We now dive into the world of mindfullness as it has become a new tool for the many to relax, destress, and quite the mind from
                        the constant chatter you experience on a day to day basis that goes on in your mind. There has been lots of research done to show
                        that just taking 5 - 10 mins in your day or however many times you'd prefer <br> Lets begin, sit in a confortable sitting position.
                        Now take deep breaths in followed along with a slow exhale and we repeat this for 3 rounds to ground ourselves in the moment.
                        Breath meditation is on of the simplest techniques out there but is the base structure of the practice, observe the breath as in
                        goes in and out. There will be a string of thoughts that come up but dont worry about them, let them bubble up as you draw back your
                        attention to the breath, just being with no judgements of yourself. These thought the arise is a natural thing as the mind slowly
                        lets go of thoughts that are coming and going which is a natural thing but we dont attach ourselves to them but just observe them around
                        realign ourselves back to the breath. As the mediation comes to an end you let go of the attention to the breath and just observe how
                        you are feeling now compared to the past moment. We then take deep breath in and slowly exhale, we do this for another 3 rounds and 
                        now open your eyes. <br> There we go a quick but simple way to destress and relax in a matter of mins.
